===================
Clojure Blog Search
===================

This is a demo application for `Alida`_, which is a search implementation
I've written for my talk on "Building a search engine with Clojure" at
`EuroClojure 2012`_. Please note that this code crawls live sites, so
use it carefully. This application is meant as real-world example
code. It is not intended to be executed, because I don't want to
create unnecessary load for the crawled sites.

About me
--------

My name is Filip de Waard. As the founder of `Vixu.com`_ I write
Clojure code for a living. The main focus of `Vixu.com`_ is providing
website-management software as a service. Under the hood we use the
free, open source `Vix`_ application to power the service. My company
is also working on a product search application written in Clojure.
